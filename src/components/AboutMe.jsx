      <p>
        I'm a software developer having involved in many aspect of software
        development life cycle aka "SDLC". I have used React to build front-end
        by connecting to back-end, which built on laravel, via Restful API. I'm
        familiar with Mysql for relational database. I have written complex sql
        query. I can design api that allows front-end to conveniently get data
        from back-end. I'm passionate about learning what are behind the scene.
        I'd like to be involved in every part of software development process,
        especially working as the team.
